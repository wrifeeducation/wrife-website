# WriFe PWP Master Framework v5.2
## Progressive Writing Practice: Independent Application System

**Version:** 5.2 (Complete Model)  
**Created:** December 2025  
**Supersedes:** v5.0, v5.1 (fundamental model corrections)  
**Status:** Definitive specification based on classroom implementation  

---

# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## What PWP Is

**Progressive Writing Practice (PWP) is an independent daily application system** where pupils practice sentence construction formulas learned in main lessons through:

- **AI-powered scaffolding** (primary delivery mechanism)
- **Systematic sentence evolution** (building complexity incrementally)
- **Self-directed learning** (pupils work independently, 5-20 minutes)
- **Adaptive progression** (formulas match individual mastery levels)
- **Paragraph composition** (begins at multi-clause sentence stage)

## What PWP Is NOT

PWP is **not**:
- A separate grammar teaching session
- Teacher-led instruction during the session
- Random sentence practice
- Disconnected from the main WriFe curriculum
- Traditional "grammar exercises"

## The Core Principle

**Main Lessons (L1-67) teach grammatical concepts in authentic writing contexts.**  
**PWP applies those concepts through independent systematic practice the next day.**

**Result:** Grammar integrated with writing, not taught separately.

---

# THE COMPLETE PWP MODEL

## 1. Relationship to Main Curriculum

```
DAY 1 - Main Lesson L11:
Teacher introduces determiners through:
- Reading examples
- Collaborative writing
- Authentic composition tasks
- Discussion and exploration

DAY 2 - PWP (Next Morning):
Pupils independently practice formulas using determiners:
- No teacher instruction
- AI provides scaffolding
- 5-10 minutes independent work
- Application of yesterday's learning
```

**PWP reinforces and applies what's taught in main lessons.**

---

## 2. The PWP Session Structure

### Stage 1: Foundation Stage (L10-15)

**Duration:** 5 minutes  
**Formulas:** 2-4 per session  
**Paragraph writing:** None yet (single-clause sentences only)

**Example - L11 Session:**
```
Subject given: "Maria"

Formula 1: subject + verb
→ Pupil writes: "Maria dances"

Formula 2: subject + verb + object
→ Pupil writes: "Maria dances tango"

Formula 3: determiner + subject + verb
→ Pupil writes: "The Maria dances"

Formula 4: determiner + subject + verb + determiner + object
→ Pupil writes: "The Maria dances the tango"

Review phase: AI provides Socratic feedback on any errors
Session complete
```

---

### Stage 2: Development Stage (L16-30)

**Duration:** 10-12 minutes  
**Formulas:** 5-7 per session  
**Paragraph writing:** BEGINS (simple before/after prompts)

**Example - L23 Session:**
```
Subject chosen by pupil: "Ben"

Formulas 1-7: Systematic evolution
1. Ben walks
2. Ben walks slowly  
3. Ben walks slowly home
4. The tired Ben walks slowly home
5. Yesterday, the tired Ben walks slowly home [pupil error - reviewed later]
6. Yesterday, the tired Ben walked slowly home [corrected]
7. Yesterday, after school, the tired Ben walked slowly home

Review phase: AI asks Socratic questions about Formula 5 tense error

Paragraph writing:
Final sentence: "Yesterday, after school, the tired Ben walked slowly home."

AI generates contextual questions:
🤔 Think about your story:
• Where was Ben before he started walking home?
• Why was Ben tired?
• What did Ben do when he arrived home?

Pupil writes 4-5 sentence paragraph

Session complete
```

---

### Stage 3: Application Stage (L30-50)

**Duration:** 12-15 minutes  
**Formulas:** 8-10 per session  
**Paragraph writing:** Standard practice with richer prompts

**Subject conditions:** "Choose a place" or "Not a person today"

**Paragraph prompts evolve:**
- "What do you see, hear, and feel in this moment?"
- "Describe the setting in detail"
- "Show the character's emotions through actions"

---

### Stage 4: Advanced Stage (L50-67)

**Duration:** 15-20 minutes  
**Formulas:** 10+ per session  
**Paragraph writing:** Thematic/perspective conditions

**Paragraph prompts:**
- "Write from the villain's perspective"
- "Theme: Hero's return"
- "Theme: Rags to riches"
- "Show this moment from a different character's viewpoint"

**Culmination:** Pupils can apply sentence construction skills to ANY writing genre - teacher just shows format/conventions.

---

## 3. Systematic Formula Evolution

### The Core Mechanism

**Each formula builds on the previous by adding ONE element.**

**NOT random separate sentences.**  
**NOT different subjects each formula.**  
**Systematic transformation of ONE foundation sentence.**

### Example Evolution Sequence (L25):

```
Foundation: "Dog runs"

Formula 1: subject + verb
→ Pupil writes complete sentence: "Dog runs"

Formula 2: subject + adverb + verb  
→ Pupil REWRITES complete sentence: "Dog quickly runs"
   (Wrote "Dog" again, wrote "runs" again, added "quickly")

Formula 3: subject + adverb + verb + preposition phrase
→ Pupil REWRITES complete sentence: "Dog quickly runs through park"
   (Wrote "Dog" 3rd time, "runs" 3rd time, "quickly" 2nd time, added phrase)

Formula 4: determiner + adjective + subject + adverb + verb + prep phrase
→ Pupil REWRITES complete sentence: "The energetic dog quickly runs through park"
   (Wrote "dog" 4th time, "runs" 4th time, added "the energetic")

Formula 5: det + adj + subject + adverb + verb + prep + det + adj + object
→ Pupil REWRITES complete sentence: "The energetic dog quickly runs through the muddy park"
   (Wrote "dog" 5th time, "runs" 5th time, enhanced "park")

Formula 6: fronted adverbial + det + adj + subject + adverb + verb + prep phrase
→ Pupil REWRITES complete sentence: "Every morning, the energetic dog quickly runs through the muddy park"
   (Wrote "dog" 6th time, "runs" 6th time, all other words again)

[Continue to 8-10 formulas depending on stage]
```

**CRITICAL: Pupils REWRITE the entire sentence each time, not just "add bits."**

**Each step is recognizable as evolution of "Dog runs" - the foundation remains visible.**

---

### The Repetition Principle

**Why complete rewriting matters:**

**Traditional "gap-filling" approach:**
```
Formula 2: [Dog] [_____] [runs]  ← Just fill the gap
```
- Minimal repetition
- Focus on new element only
- Weak memory formation
- No motor memory development

**WriFe complete rewriting approach:**
```
Formula 2: Write entire new sentence: "Dog quickly runs"
```
- Full repetition of previous elements
- Integration of new element with known elements
- Strong memory formation through motor practice
- Neural pathway reinforcement

**By Formula 6, pupils have written "Dog" SIX times and "runs" SIX times.**

This is not busywork - this is **systematic spaced repetition built into the structure.**

---

### Digital Platform Implementation

**Word bank + typing interface:**

```
Formula 3 example:

Your words from before: [Dog] [quickly] [runs]

Build your sentence:
Click previous words + type new phrase

Sentence builder: [____________]

Actions:
1. Click [Dog]
2. Click [quickly]  
3. Click [runs]
4. Type "through park"

Result: "Dog quickly runs through park"
```

**Pupils physically reconstruct** by clicking each known word, reinforcing position and spelling, then add new element.

---

### Physical Booklet Implementation

**Labelled examples + complete rewriting:**

```
Formula 3: subject + adverb + verb + prepositional phrase

LABELLED EXAMPLE:
Dog     quickly    runs    through the park
(subject) (adverb)   (verb)  (prepositional phrase)

YOUR TURN - REWRITE your complete sentence:
_________________________________________________

💡 Write your subject, adverb, verb again, THEN add 
   your prepositional phrase
```

**Pupils write the full sentence by hand**, creating motor memory through physical repetition.

---

### Pedagogical Basis

**Neuroscience of learning:**

1. **Spaced Repetition Effect** (Ebbinghaus)
   - Information repeated over intervals (formulas 1-7) retained longer
   - Each formula = spaced repetition session
   - Built into structure, no separate revision needed

2. **Motor Learning** (Schmidt)
   - Physical act of writing reinforces memory
   - Hand-brain connection strengthens neural pathways
   - Each rewriting = motor practice session

3. **Deliberate Practice** (Ericsson)
   - Focused attention on ONE new element each time
   - Repetition of mastered elements reduces cognitive load
   - Systematic skill building through incremental complexity

4. **Retrieval Practice** (Bjork)
   - Each formula requires recall of previous elements
   - Active retrieval stronger than passive review
   - Testing effect built into every formula

**Result:** By Formula 7-10, foundation sentence is AUTOMATIC. Pupils don't think about "dog runs" - they KNOW it.

---

## 4. AI-Powered Scaffolding System

### Primary Delivery Mechanism

**PWP is delivered primarily through digital AI system because:**

1. **Adaptive formula generation** - AI generates formulas based on:
   - Curriculum map (what lesson teaches)
   - Individual mastery data (what pupil has mastered)
   - Performance patterns (what needs reinforcement)

2. **Socratic feedback** - AI teaches through questions, not answers

3. **Contextual paragraph prompts** - AI generates questions specific to pupil's sentence

4. **Automatic remediation** - AI detects struggles and provides micro-sessions

5. **Infinite variation** - AI can vary subjects, tenses, contexts to prevent memorization

### AI Formula Generation Algorithm

```python
def generate_pwp_formulas(pupil_id, lesson_number):
    """
    Generate systematic formula progression for individual pupil
    """
    # Step 1: Get curriculum baseline
    baseline_concepts = curriculum_map[lesson_number]
    # Example L23: [noun, verb, determiner, adjective, adverb, preposition, fronted_adverbial]
    
    # Step 2: Check pupil's individual mastery
    mastery_data = get_mastery_status(pupil_id)
    # Returns: {noun: MASTERED, verb: MASTERED, determiner: MASTERED,
    #          adjective: MASTERED, adverb: PRACTICING, 
    #          preposition: NEEDS_SUPPORT, fronted_adverbial: NEW}
    
    # Step 3: Determine formula count based on stage
    if lesson_number <= 15:
        formula_count = 3-4
    elif lesson_number <= 30:
        formula_count = 5-7
    elif lesson_number <= 50:
        formula_count = 8-10
    else:
        formula_count = 10-12
    
    # Step 4: Generate systematic progression
    formulas = []
    foundation = "subject + verb"  # Always start here
    formulas.append(foundation)
    
    # Build progressively
    # Formulas 1-4: Use MASTERED concepts (confidence building)
    # Formulas 5-7: Include PRACTICING concepts (consolidation)
    # Formulas 8-10: Challenge with NEW/NEEDS_SUPPORT concepts (growth)
    
    for i in range(formula_count - 1):
        previous_formula = formulas[-1]
        
        if i < 3:  # Early formulas - use mastered concepts
            next_element = choose_from(mastery_data, status="MASTERED")
        elif i < 6:  # Middle formulas - include practicing
            next_element = choose_from(mastery_data, status="PRACTICING")
        else:  # Later formulas - push boundaries
            next_element = choose_from(mastery_data, status=["NEW", "NEEDS_SUPPORT"])
        
        new_formula = add_element(previous_formula, next_element)
        formulas.append(new_formula)
    
    return formulas
```

### Socratic Feedback Examples

**Error Type 1: Wrong word class**
```
Pupil writes: "The happy Maria dances quick"
(Used adjective "quick" instead of adverb "quickly")

AI Feedback:
❌ Check the last word in your sentence

🤔 Think about:
• You're describing HOW Maria dances, right?
• When we describe how an action is done, do we use adjectives or adverbs?
• "Quick" is an adjective (describes nouns: "the quick dog")
• What word class do we need to describe verbs?
• Can you change "quick" to its adverb form?

💡 Hint: Most adverbs end in "-ly"

[Try again]
```

**Error Type 2: Tense mismatch**
```
Pupil writes: "Yesterday, Maria dances beautifully"

AI Feedback:
❌ Something doesn't match in this sentence

🤔 Think about:
• "Yesterday" tells us about what time? (past/present/future)
• Look at "dances" - is that a past tense or present tense verb?
• If something happened yesterday, should we use past or present tense?
• What is the past tense form of "dances"?

💡 Hint: You only need to change ONE word

[Try again]
```

**Error Type 3: Missing element**
```
Pupil writes: "Maria dances beautifully"
(Formula requires: determiner + subject + verb + adverb)

AI Feedback:
❌ You're missing something at the beginning

🤔 Think about:
• The formula needs: determiner + subject + verb + adverb
• You have: subject + verb + adverb
• What's missing?
• A determiner tells us WHICH Maria (the, a, my)
• Which determiner fits your sentence?

[Try again]
```

### Contextual Paragraph Question Generation

**Example 1: Action-based sentence**
```
Pupil's final formula: "The brave knight fought the dragon fiercely"

AI analyzes:
- Subject: knight (person, hero role)
- Action: fought (conflict, past tense)
- Object: dragon (antagonist, fantasy)
- Manner: fiercely (intensity)

AI generates contextual questions:
🤔 Build your paragraph:
• Where was the knight before encountering the dragon?
• Why did the knight choose to fight rather than flee?
• How did the dragon react to the fierce attack?
• What happened to both of them after the battle?

Write 4-6 sentences telling this story.
```

**Example 2: Descriptive sentence**
```
Pupil's final formula: "The old library sits quietly in the town centre"

AI analyzes:
- Subject: library (place, building)
- Action: sits (state, present tense)
- Manner: quietly (peaceful atmosphere)
- Location: town centre (setting)

AI generates contextual questions:
🤔 Build your paragraph:
• What does the library look like from the outside?
• What sounds can you hear near the quiet library?
• Who visits this library in the town centre?
• How does the library make the town centre feel?

Write 4-6 sentences describing this place.
```

**Example 3: Character-focused sentence**
```
Pupil's final formula: "Yesterday, the usually shy Maria surprisingly stood up"

AI analyzes:
- Subject: Maria (person, character trait: shy)
- Time: yesterday (past event)
- Action: stood up (physical movement, significant because unusual)
- Manner: surprisingly (unexpected behavior change)

AI generates contextual questions:
🤔 Build your paragraph:
• What was Maria doing before she stood up?
• Why is it surprising that shy Maria would stand up?
• What made Maria overcome her shyness in that moment?
• How did other people react when Maria stood up?

Write 4-6 sentences exploring this moment.
```

## 5. Mastery-Based Progression

### Individual Advancement System

**Unlike main curriculum (whole class progresses L1→L67 together), PWP progression is individualized:**

```
CLASSROOM REALITY - Week 12:

Main Lesson: L27 (whole class learning paragraph organization)

PWP Levels:
- Sarah: L29 PWP (ahead of main lesson)
- James: L24 PWP (slightly behind)
- Maya: L27 PWP (aligned)
- Ben: L20 PWP (needs more time)

All acceptable - pupils progress at own pace in PWP
```

### Mastery Criteria

**AI considers concept "mastered" using weighted factors:**

**PRIMARY (60% weight): Time since introduction**
```
10+ lessons ago + used regularly → MASTERED
3-9 lessons ago → PRACTICING
0-2 lessons ago → NEW/EMERGING
```

**SECONDARY (30% weight): Accuracy percentage**
```
80%+ → Strong
60-79% → Developing  
<60% → Needs support
```

**TERTIARY (10% weight): Consistency trend**
```
Recent improvement → Confidence building
Recent decline → May need review
```

**Example Calculation:**

```
Sarah - L25 - Prepositional Phrases:

Factor 1: Learned in L18 (7 lessons ago) → PRACTICING (60 points)
Factor 2: 85% accuracy overall → Strong (30 points)
Factor 3: Last 5 attempts: 4/5 correct → Stable (10 points)

Total Score: 100 points → STATUS: MASTERED

AI will include prepositional phrases freely in future formulas
```

```
Ben - L25 - Prepositional Phrases:

Factor 1: Learned in L18 (7 lessons ago) → PRACTICING (60 points)
Factor 2: 55% accuracy overall → Needs support (15 points)
Factor 3: Last 5 attempts: 2/5 correct → Declining (5 points)

Total Score: 80 points → STATUS: NEEDS SUPPORT

AI will:
1. Trigger remedial micro-session before next PWP
2. Include prepositional phrases WITH heavy scaffolding
3. Monitor closely for improvement
```

### Automatic Remediation System

**When AI detects struggle (score <70 on any concept):**

```
NEXT PWP SESSION:

Sarah logs in normally → Straight to regular PWP

Ben logs in → Remedial micro-session appears first

└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘

After completion → Regular L25 PWP begins
```

**No teacher action required - AI handles individual remediation automatically.**

---

## 6. Subject Selection Progression

### Phase 1: Subject Given (First ~5 PWP sessions)

**Teacher/AI assigns subject:**
```
L10 PWP: Subject = "Dog"
L11 PWP: Subject = "Maria"  
L12 PWP: Subject = "Ben"
L13 PWP: Subject = "Bird"
L14 PWP: Subject = "Car"
```

**Purpose:** Pupils focus on learning the PWP routine and understanding formulas without the cognitive load of choosing subjects.

---

### Phase 2: Free Choice (After ~5 sessions)

**Pupil chooses own subject:**
```
L15 PWP: "Choose your subject - any person, animal, place, or thing"

Pupil chooses: "London"

All formulas use "London" throughout session
```

**Purpose:** Growing independence while maintaining focus.

---

### Phase 3: Conditional Choice (Ongoing)

**Conditions prevent defaulting to familiar subjects:**

**Early conditions (L20-35):**
- "Choose a place" (forces abstract thinking about non-animate subjects)
- "Not a person today" (prevents always writing about people)
- "Choose an animal"
- "Choose a thing" (most challenging)

**Middle conditions (L35-50):**
- "Choose a place and use past tense"
- "Choose a thing and describe it moving"
- "Write about weather"

**Advanced conditions (L50-67):**
- "Write from a villain's perspective"
- "Theme: Rags to riches"
- "Theme: Hero's return"
- "Write as if recounting a childhood memory"

**Purpose:** 
- Prevent pupils from always choosing comfortable subjects (people)
- Force application of formulas across different contexts
- Develop flexible writing skills
- Prepare for thematic/perspective work

---

## 7. Teacher Role in PWP

### NOT: Daily Instructor

**Teacher does NOT:**
- Model sentences during PWP
- Lead guided practice
- Provide direct instruction
- Circulate helping individuals during session
- Mark PWP work manually

### IS: Data Monitor and Strategic Interventionist

**Teacher DOES:**

**1. One-Time Setup (L10):**
```
Introduces PWP routine:
- Shows how to log in / open booklet
- Demonstrates working through formulas
- Explains review phase
- Models paragraph writing process
- Sets expectations for independence

Time: 20-30 minutes (happens ONCE at L10)
```

**2. Daily Monitoring (2-5 minutes during PWP):**
```
Opens teacher dashboard
Scans class overview:
- Who's progressing smoothly?
- Who's stuck?
- Any patterns emerging?

Takes notes for strategic decisions

Does NOT interrupt or teach during PWP
```

**3. Pattern Recognition:**
```
Dashboard shows:
"⚠️ 8 pupils struggling with fronted adverbials"

Teacher notes:
- If <5 pupils: Let AI handle via remediation
- If 8+ pupils: Concept needs re-teaching in main lesson

Decision: Tomorrow's L26 main lesson will include
extra focus on fronted adverbials for whole class
```

**4. Strategic Intervention:**
```
Weekly review of PWP data shows:
- Ben stuck at L20 for 3 weeks
- Persistent struggle with adjectives
- Accuracy not improving

Teacher action:
- One-to-one conference with Ben
- Check for underlying issues
- Provide targeted support
- Possibly adjust expectations

Note: This is STRATEGIC intervention (weekly pattern),
not daily teaching during PWP
```

## 8. Physical Booklet Design (Backup for Schools Without IT)

### Limitations Acknowledged

**Physical booklet cannot:**
- Adapt formulas to individual mastery

## 9. Integration with Main Curriculum

### The Learning Sequence

```
WEEK 1:

Monday - Main Lesson L11:
- Teacher introduces determiners
- Pupils explore determiners in reading
- Collaborative writing activities  
- Authentic composition practice
- 45-60 minute lesson

Tuesday-Friday - PWP (each morning):
- 5-10 minute independent practice
- Pupils apply determiner formulas
- AI scaffolds, teacher monitors
- No instruction during PWP

RESULT:
- Grammar taught in writing context (not isolation)
- Immediate application through PWP
- Distributed practice throughout week
- Skills integrated, not separated
```

### Why This Works

**Traditional Approach (Separated):**
```
Grammar Lesson → Decontextualized exercises → Hope for transfer

Problem: Skills don't transfer to authentic writing
```

**WriFe Approach (Integrated):**
```
Concept taught in context → Immediate application → Distributed practice → Automatic use

Result: Skills embedded in authentic writing
```

## 10. The Complete Transformation Journey

### From Simple to Sophisticated

**The power of PWP is visible transformation:**

```
L10 (Week 1):
Foundation sentence: "Maria dances"

L15 (Week 6):
Evolution: "The young Maria dances gracefully"

L25 (Week 16):
Evolution: "Yesterday, the young Maria danced gracefully at the party"

L40 (Week 31):
Evolution: "Yesterday evening, while everyone was watching, 
the usually shy young Maria surprisingly danced gracefully 
at the crowded party"

L67 (Week 58):
Evolution: "During the end of year celebration, while everyone 
was sitting and listening to the music being played by the band, 
the usually shy young Maria, who rarely spoke in groups of more 
than three people, surprisingly stood up and danced gracefully 
across the floor before returning to her seat"

→ Then writes full paragraph using this as topic sentence
```

**Pupils SEE their growth week by week.**

**2 words → 50+ words**

**Simple clause → Complex sophisticated sentence**

**Sentence → Paragraph → Text**

---

## 11. The Pinnacle: Skills Application to Any Genre

### Stage 4 Achievement (L50-67)

**By L50-67, pupils have mastered sentence construction.**

**Main lessons shift to showing genre CONVENTIONS:**

```
Main Lesson L56: Letter Writing

Teacher: "This is what a formal letter looks like"
[Shows format, greeting, closing, address placement]

PWP continues: Sentence construction practice

Writing Task: "Write a formal letter to the headteacher"

Pupil applies:
- Sentence construction skills (from PWP)
- Letter conventions (from main lesson)
- Writes sophisticated formal letter

No "letter writing unit" needed - pupils already have the skills!
```

**Same for:**
- Newspaper reports (show format → pupils apply skills)
- Persuasive speeches (show techniques → pupils apply skills)
- Story writing (show narrative structure → pupils apply skills)
- Instructions (show format → pupils apply skills)

**Result: Pupils are WRITERS who can adapt to any genre, not genre-template followers.**

2. Reading the formula
3. Writing systematic evolution
4. Using AI feedback / self-check
5. Review and correction process
6. (Later) Paragraph writing process

**Then pupils practice independently thereafter.**

---

## Quality Assurance

### Monitoring Effectiveness

**Weekly Metrics:**
- % pupils completing PWP daily
- Average formulas completed per session
- Accuracy rates by lesson level
- Remediation trigger frequency
- Paragraph writing engagement

**Monthly Analysis:**
- Formula mastery progression rates
- Correlation between PWP accuracy and main lesson writing quality
- Subject type variety
- Teacher intervention patterns

**Termly Evaluation:**
- Writing sample analysis (sentence complexity growth)
- Pupil voice surveys (PWP experience)
- Teacher feedback (dashboard utility, time efficiency)
- Parent feedback (visible progress)

---

# CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

## 1. Maintaining Independence

**Threat:** Teachers revert to instruction during PWP

**Prevention:**
- Clear training on teacher role
- Dashboard designed for monitoring, not intervention
- Time expectations (2-5 min monitoring, not 20 min teaching)
- Celebration of pupil independence

---

## 2. AI Feedback Quality

**Threat:** AI gives answers instead of questions

**Prevention:**
- Socratic prompt engineering
- Regular review of AI responses
- Teacher override capability
- Continuous improvement based on examples

---

## 3. Physical Booklet Self-Sufficiency

**Threat:** Booklet pupils dependent on teacher help

**Prevention:**
- Extensive worked examples
- Clear self-check mechanisms
- Tiered difficulty with clear stopping points
- Teacher training on minimal intervention

---

## 4. Preventing PWP-Main Lesson Disconnect

**Threat:** PWP becomes "just an exercise" unconnected to real writing

**Prevention:**
- Explicit teaching of connection in training
- Dashboard shows correlation metrics
- Teacher references PWP growth in main lessons
- Celebration of sentence evolution in authentic writing

---

## 5. Sustaining Teacher Buy-In

**Threat:** Teachers see dashboard monitoring as "extra work"

**Prevention:**
- 2-5 minute daily time commitment (realistic)
- Data actually useful for planning (not busywork)
- Visible pupil progress (motivating)
- Reduced marking burden (AI handles PWP feedback)

---

# CONCLUSION
