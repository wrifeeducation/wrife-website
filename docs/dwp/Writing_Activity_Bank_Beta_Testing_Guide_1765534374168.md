## AI FEEDBACK VALIDATION PROTOCOL

### Sample Size Requirements

**Per Level:**
- Minimum 10 pupil responses
- Mix of abilities (low/medium/high)
- Range of scores (0-100%)

**Review Process:**
1. Pupil completes activity
2. AI generates feedback
3. Teacher reviews pupil work independently
4. Teacher rates AI feedback:
   - Assessment accuracy (1-5)
   - Feedback appropriateness (1-5)
   - Helpfulness (1-5)
5. Teacher notes any concerns
6. Flagged items reviewed by you

### Red Flags for AI Feedback

**Immediate Review Needed:**
- Score drastically different from teacher judgment (>20% off)
- Harsh or discouraging language
- Inappropriate for age level
- Misses obvious errors
- Praises incorrect work
- Teaching point is wrong/confusing
- Technical terminology too advanced

### Calibration Process

**Weekly Calibration Meetings:**
1. Review 5-10 flagged assessments
2. Discuss disagreements
3. Refine rubrics if needed
4. Update system prompt if pattern emerges
5. Document decisions
